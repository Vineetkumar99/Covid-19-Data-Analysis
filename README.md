# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

Predicting COVID-19 in India using Machine Learning'.In this Project, we will take a COVID-19 dataset and understand how the disease has spread across different states in India. We will perform some data manipulation and data visualization operations on top of the dataset. We will also be implementing a linear regression algorithm to understand the number of active and recovered cases
